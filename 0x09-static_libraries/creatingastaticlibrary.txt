gcc -c add.c subtract.c compile until the object files are generated nothing more nothing less
ar rcs libmathutils.a add.o subtract.o
	ar atands for archive, it's basically the command to create the library

	The 'r' flag tells it to replace older object files in the library, with the new object files.

	The 'c' flag tells ar to create the library if it doesn't already exist.

ranlib mylib.a
	After an archive is created, or modified, there is a need to index it. This index is later used by the compiler to speed up symbol-lookup
	inside the library.

gcc main.c -o myprogram -L. -lmylib
	this is how to include the library in any program during compilation

	-L.: Tells the compiler to look in the current directory for the library.(this is just the path, replace with absolute path if the library
	is not in the current directory)

	'-l' flag tells the linker to use the mylib.a library
